/**
 * Fonts are fetched at BUILD time and self-hosted in the output.
 *
 * This is a genuine advantage over the WordPress route: no runtime request to
 * a third-party font CDN, so no third-party data flow to disclose and no
 * render-blocking external fetch. `display: swap` protects against invisible
 * text while loading.
 *
 * The three faces are group property, taken from the pattern guide: Newsreader
 * for display, Outfit for body, IBM Plex Mono for eyebrows, figures and small
 * labels. Self-hosting means the strict CSP (font-src 'self') needs no change.
 * Do NOT add a Google Fonts <link>; it will be blocked.
 *
 * Display weight is 500. The guide's stylesheet says 300; Appendix E records
 * the group moving to 400 during the first conversion because the light cut
 * read as too fragile at desktop sizes. This site moved again, to 500, on the
 * user's by-eye call after seeing it rendered: at 42px the 400 cut of a serif
 * read as washed out beside the brand marks it sits above.
 *
 * It moved EVERYWHERE at once, which is the rule — .h1, .h1p, .h2, .h3, the
 * prose heading, the validation-route lead-in and the orbit core. Leaving one
 * behind is how an interior page ends up with a heading lighter than the
 * subheadings underneath it.
 *
 * This is now a GROUP-LEVEL divergence. It needs carrying to Appendix E and to
 * the guide's author exactly as the 300 -> 400 move was. Until it is, Holdings
 * and Certified render the same class at different weights.

          Scroll reveal, whole mechanism. FIRST in the body so it runs during
          parse, before anything paints — otherwise the page renders visible and
          then blinks out as the attribute lands.

          IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON REACT, and that is deliberate. The first version
          set the attribute here and left the observing to a hydrated component;
          measured in Chrome, hydration on the five legal routes lost the race
          with the failsafe, so the reveal quietly did nothing. A visitor on a
          slow connection would have hit the same thing in production. The
          observer therefore starts at DOMContentLoaded and owes React nothing.
          ScrollReveal only re-scans after a client-side navigation, through the
          window.__revealScan hook exposed here.

          It is the ONLY thing that sets data-reveal, and only when the browser
          can observe intersections and the visitor has not asked for reduced
          motion. No script, no attribute, nothing hidden: the page is simply
          static. That is the correct failure direction, and the one the deleted
          ScrollEffects got wrong — see globals.css and commit 58cb09c.

          Both the catch and the 3s timer exist to remove the attribute if the
          scan never completes. Better a static page than a blank one.

          IT WRITES NOTHING REACT RENDERS UNTIL REACT HAS HYDRATED (18 Sep
          2026). Observing starts at once, but an element that intersects
          before hydration is QUEUED, and its is-revealed class is added when
          ScrollReveal calls window.__revealReady after hydrating. Adding the
          class earlier made React report a hydration mismatch on any section
          already in view at load. The stagger index is CSS (:nth-child) for
          the same reason. If hydration never comes, the 2.5s timer flushes
          the queue anyway, so a failed bundle cannot leave content hidden.

          Inline is permitted here: the CSP sets script-src 'self'
          'unsafe-inline'. Do not move this to an external file — a fetched
          script cannot beat first paint, which is the whole reason it exists.
